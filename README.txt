A3.0 WPF Calculator

Running the program does not require anything special or specific, a couple things to note however, when in
the program:

After pressing the equal button (=) and having the result displayed, make sure to press the C button before
going on to do a new calculation.
There is no backspace button implemented, just click the CE or C button to start over.
As stated in the video, when calculating square root, press the sqrt button first and then the number you
wish to find the square root of.
Decimals cannot be operated with.
